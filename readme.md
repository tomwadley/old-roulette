# Roulette

Note: This is part of the *"Old stuff I wrote when I was a kid"* series.

## Description

A roulette game I made in VB6 for a schoole science project in 2002 when I was 13.

I've included the explanatory html file (that looks like it was saved out of Word) that I wrote at the time.

You start with a number of chips which you can click to place on the board in all of the different ways you can in Roulette. After betting, you click to spin the wheel. The idea was to demonstrate that playing Roulette is a bad idea!

Being VB6, you may not be able to get it to run on modern Windows. If you have a Windows XP machine handy or you can be bothered resolving the dependencies you'll be able to check it out. [This](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290887) downloadable from Microsoft might do the trick.
